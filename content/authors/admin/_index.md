I am the Founder-Owner-CEO of Ase Center for Stress and Trauma, trauma-focused therapist, and doctoral student. My research interests include stress-related systems (with a focus on the parasympathetic nervous system), stress- and trauma-related disorders, stress vulnerability and resilience, and social determinants of health (i.e., class and race). I am interested in bridging the research, practice, programming, policy, and technology gap.
