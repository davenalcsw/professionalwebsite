## About

I’m a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) and aspiring behavioral neuroscientist. 
I am driven by a simple vision: to do work that solves problems, improves quality of life, and creates equitable systems that reduce disparities in health and well-being outcomes. 

As a PhD candidate, I spend my time on end-to-end quantitative research projects 
(i.e., conception to presentation). Alongside my psychology and neuroscience training, I’ve developed skills in 
**research design and methodology, descriptive and inferential statistics, regression models, data visualization, and science communication. Working primarily with R and large health-related datasets**, 
I explore complex research questions using advanced statistical analyses 
(e.g., moderation, mediation, structural equation modeling); contextual, psychosocial, and behavioral measures; 
and biological data. I’m particularly interested in how data-driven methods can improve our understanding of social determinants of health,
biomarkers, and behavioral health; and the potential to transform the way we promote health and well-being, especially
for marginalized and underserved populations.

My research and scientific pursuits are driven by two core goals: 
1. Building a more rigorous, equity-driven, empirical foundation for understanding behavior and mental health outcomes 
2. Generating insights that can be applied to the development of products, social policies, and services that 
can improve health and well-being

I'm also a social worker with over 10 years of experience. Currently, I provide mental health treatment to adults
navigating stress- and trauma-related disorders. Before starting my doctoral training, I worked with children,
adults, and families from a variety of backgrounds. My experience has also included:
* Leading internal assessment and evaluation projects to measure program impact and improve business services
* Using qualitative methods, including interviews and focus groups, and analysis to understand participant experience
* Synthesizing literature and making recommendations to key stakeholders and senior leadership

Combining my experiences, I thrive at the intersection of research, data, and real-world impact — translating 
complex findings into insights that improve decision-making. I'm most energized when analytical rigor meets social purpose.

Outside of work, I enjoy strength training, watching/listening to something for educational or entertainment purposes (e.g., anime, podcasts, audiobooks), and traveling.
