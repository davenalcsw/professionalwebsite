summary: >-
  North Carolina saw one of the largest increases in family homelessness. 
  Strong evidence supports the use of permanent, tenant-based rental assistance for 
  preventing and reducing family homelessness. North Carolina should establish a state-level program 
  to support North Carolina families and eliminate family homelessness.

Stable, safe, affordable housing is vital for child and family health.
But, a growing number of North Carolina families are experiencing
homelessness. According to the 2024 Point-in-Time (PIT) count estimate,
North Carolina saw the **fifth largest increase** in family homelessness
between 2023 and 2024. Also, the **number of children using
McKinney-Vento services** **increased by 80%** between the 2020-2021
(20,325) and 2021-2022 (25,427) school years. As housing costs outpace
wage growth, family homelessness will continue to rise. **Permanent,
deep, tenant-based rental assistance is a proven and cost-effective way
to reduce family homelessness.** To reduce family homelessness, North
Carolina should create a state-level program to expand access to
permanent, deep, tenant-based rental assistance.

{{% callout note %}} **Definitions**

**Family**: a household with at least one adult over the age of 18
serving as the caretaker for at least one child under the age of 18

**Literal homelessness**: defined by HUD as lacking "fixed, regular, and
adequate nighttime residence" and used for the Point-in-Time (PIT)
count.

**Point-in-Time (PIT) count**: a yearly survey conducted in the US of
people experiencing literal homelessness on a single night in January

**McKinney-Vento Act**: provides services to students who meet the
definition for literal homelessness or are tentatively housed (e.g.,
doubled up with family, living in a hotel, or substandard housing)

**"Deep"**: a subsidy that covers the difference between an allowable
rent amount and 30% of household income

**Tenant-based**: assistance that is attached to a household allowing a
household to move to different units

**Affordable**: housing and utilities are 30% or less of gross income

**Cost-burden**: housing and utilities are over 30% of gross income
{{% /callout %}}

**Children under six are the most likely to be in families experiencing
homelessness**

Adults in families experiencing homelessness are predominantly young,
single mothers working low-wage jobs due to limited education, skills,
and work experience. On average, there are two children. **Children
under the age of six make up the majority of children experiencing
homelessness.** Consistent with other indicators of systemic economic
and social issues, Black and Hispanic families are over-represented.
Current counts likely underestimate the scope of the problem because
families are more likely to be tentatively housed or have children who
are too young to use Mckinney-Vento services.

**Consistent evidence shows that homelessness can worsen outcomes for
children**

For children, experiencing homelessness can have long-term negative
effects. Both exposure to homelessness before and after birth are
associated with worse health and developmental outcomes. Homelessness is
also associated with poorer development outcomes across multiple domains
during early childhood and an increased risk for mental health issues in
elementary school children. Timing and duration matter. **Younger
children and children exposed to homelessness for six months or longer
had the worst health outcomes.** For example, infants that experienced
an emergency shelter stay had poorer health outcomes and higher
healthcare costs compared to children that did not stay in a shelter,
with some differences persisting for years.

**Hard-working parents are struggling to afford housing in North
Carolina**

Most experts agree that family homelessness is the result of low wages
combined with limited affordable housing. A 2017 study found that area
level median rent was the most consistent predictor of family
homelessness. In North Carolina, the 2024 fair market rent for a two
bedroom was \$1,311 per month. According to the National Low Income
Housing Coalition, the hourly wage needed to afford a 2-bedroom in 2024
was \$25.21 per hour. But the hourly wage for many jobs is not enough
for a single parent working full-time to afford a 2-bedroom. There is
also a significant gap in the availability of affordable units for
families with low-incomes. **For every 100 households at 50% AMI
(\$1,955 per month) or less, there are only 66 units available**. Low
wages combined with this gap increase the number of cost-burdened
families and make it difficult for parents to find safe, stable,
affordable housing.

in Charlotte compared to rent](jobs_and_rent.png)

**Many homelessness and housing affordability strategies do NOT reduce
family homelessness**

-   **Increase supply of affordable housing:** The Housing Trust Fund
    (HTF) and Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) are common paths
    used to increase housing supply, especially of project-based units.
    However, due to high housing costs and shrinking profit margins,
    units often remain unaffordable for low-income families.

-   **Project-based rental assistance (PBRA):** PBRA is attached to a
    development and available to a family living in one of the units.
    The development is likely owned by the local housing authority or
    built through HTF or LIHTC. Unlike TBRA, families do not have the
    option to take assistance with them limiting mobility and choice.

-   **Tenant-based rental assistance (TBRA):** TBRA is provided to a
    household as a voucher. Families with assistance can use it to make
    a project-based unit more affordable or can rent a unit in the
    private rental market. TBRA can be shallow---often a flat rate---or
    deep---households contribute 30% of their income toward rent. The
    duration of assistance may be temporary (e.g., rapid re-housing) or
    permanent (e.g., housing choice voucher).

In North Carolina, significant investments have been made to increase
the supply of affordable housing and/or provide temporary rental
assistance, in some cases with supportive services intended to address
social and economic challenges. While these strategies are an important
part of a comprehensive plan to address the homelessness crisis, they do
not reduce family homelessness.

{{% callout note %}} **Policy Recommendation**:

North Carolina should create a state-level program to expand access to
permanent, deep, tenant-based rental assistance to reduce family
homelessness and improve housing, health, and economic mobility outcomes
for children, parents and families {{% /callout %}}

The one strategy that has been found to improve housing quality and
stability, mental and physical health, and healthcare access is TBRA.
Specifically, **permanent, deep, tenant-based rental assistance has the
strongest evidence for reducing and preventing family homelessness,**
making it the most cost-effective strategy.

![image of a table highlighting the benefits of tenant-based rental
assistance compared to other forms of rental support](tbra_benefits.png)

**Despite strong evidence for permanent, deep, tenant-based rental
assistance, concerns remain**

Concerns over cost, effects on employment, and potential impact on
rental prices have served as barriers to expanding permanent, deep
tenant-based rental assistance (PDTBRA) at the federal- and state-level.

-   **Employment:** An evaluation of a HUD-funded PBRA program that
    included supportive services found that participation in the program
    **did NOT affect employment.** An evaluation of a second HUD funded
    project found that there was a **small decrease in employment and
    earnings, but the difference was negligible.**

-   **Rental prices:** A study investigating the impact of
    vouchers/subsidies on rental prices found that there was **NO impact
    on rental prices**.

-   **Cost:** PDTBRA costs less than building new affordable units.
    According to a rigorous study conducted over three years, PDTBRA
    costs \$3,768 more than doing nothing, \$3,925 more than rapid
    re-housing, and \$4,102 more than PBRA. **Although alternatives to
    PDTBRA may cost less, these alternatives do not reduce family
    homelessness or improve other outcomes**.

![image of a bar graph comparing the cost of tenant-based rental
assistance to other forms of rental support](comparison.png)

{{% callout note %}}**North Carolina can expand access to permanent,
deep, tenant-based rental assistance through**:

1.  **Direct rental assistance to families**: Expanding access to rental
    assistance for families could be accomplished through existing
    programs such as the Housing Trust Fund or creating a state-level
    voucher program. States like Iowa, Massachusetts, and Connecticut
    have created state-level programs.

2.  **Owner-claimed tax credits**: The Center on Budget and Policy
    Priorities and UC Berkeley's Terner Center for Housing Innovation
    have proposed creating a renter's tax credit program that would
    allow an owner who agrees to reduce rent to 30% of a family's income
    to claim a quarterly tax credit.

**Design considerations:**

**Partnering:** Landlord willingness to accept a voucher is critical for
success. A state-level program should focus on creating partnerships
with landlords and providing rental search support for families.

**Prioritizing:** Timing and duration matter for children. Current
evidence suggests that targeting families with children under the age of
13 would maximize benefits.

**Maximizing:** Moving to areas with better opportunities improves
long-term outcomes. A state-level program should focus on supporting a
family's move to a lower-poverty, higher-income neighborhood.
{{% /callout %}}

**Conclusion**

Homelessness should be "rare, brief, and non-recurring". For too many
families in North Carolina, that is not the case. A comprehensive family
homelessness reduction approach must address the gap between income and
housing costs for hard-working families with low-income. **Permanent,
deep, tenant-based rental assistance is a commonsense solution for
addressing this gap, reducing family homelessness, and improving
housing, health, and self-sufficiency outcomes for children and
families.** Expanding access to permanent, deep, tenant-based rental
assistance is cost-effective and would maximize return on investment.
Family homelessness can be reduced in North Carolina by using resources
more efficiently and investing in a state-level permanent, deep,
tenant-based rental assistance program.
