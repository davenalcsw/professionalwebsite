Honored to have been invited to participate in a mental health awareness outreach event today!

I had the pleasure of developing an interactive activity with the goal being to provide psycho-education about 
stress biology, mental health, and the benefits of breathing. 

Attendees responded positively to the interactive activity I created for the event. 
I had an amazing time helping attendees discuss their current stressors and stress 
management strategies and facilitating a breathing and reflection exercise. 

It was a great opportunity to combine science with service.
